1. We need to be sure that you understand the serious consequences of not
   handling malware carefully for this project. In your own words, restate the
   important notice from the homework handout.

> We could get into very significant trouble if we wre to accidentally release
> malware into the wild. So it is very important that we do not run it or
> allow it to get out in any form. The excuse of "academics" will not suffice.

2. Did you execute or attempt to execute any malware in the course of this
   project?

> No

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. In the POSIX thread model, what happens if the parent thread is terminated?
   Will child threads continue to run?

> *** The child threads are detached from the parent thread, so they will
> continue to run.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Besides in-line malware analysis, what are some other benefits or uses of
   proxy servers? Give 2 brief examples.

> Proxy servers can act as a firewalls, by dropping packets from hosts not
> specifically contacted. 
> 

> Proxy servers can act as anonymizing agents. *** details ***
> 
> 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. How would you adapt the proxy server to serve as an ad-blocker? Be brief.

> A proxy server could not accept files (in many cases images) that are hosted
> anywhere that isn't the website being accessed by the client. A way to do it
> with fewer false positives may be to block all image files that can route
> client to a different website upon click.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. The suggested way to approach the project is to scan every file retrieved,
   even if they have been downloaded and tested before. How can you optimize
   the performance of the system without affecting safety?

> A list of trusted sites would reduce the proxy's overhead. Alternatively and
> likely better, it could maintain a list of files recently accessed; overhead
> would decrease sites in a reasonable time period likely didn't change.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. How effective is ClamAV at detecting malware? Are there examples of malware
   that the ClamAV library did not detect?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Will the proxy system designed in this project protect against Javascript
   attacks?

> ******* decompile the .x files and see if they are js? ********

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Does it make sense for your proxy system to recompress data before sending
   it back to the browser? Why or why not?

> ******* No, that is a lot of cycles to wait *******

10.Did you ensure that your submission contains only the README, your source
   files and a working Makefile?

> Yes

11.(this question is not graded and is optional). Did you enjoy this homework?
   Was it very educational? What suggestions do you have to improve future
   iterations of this assignment? Also feel free to add any other comments
